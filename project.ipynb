      "-  It s a very minor issue Our room had a nice rain shower which worked very well but the shower base was a bit slippery and was too flat to effectively drain the water away fast enough Water tended to flow under the shower door onto the floor in the area of the toilet The bathroom is sort of open plan and is right in front of you as soon as you enter the room This didn t bother us at all but it is a somewhat strange layout \n",
      "-  The curtains were not closing completely so light was entering the room No posibility to open the windows therefore no fresh air \n",
      "-  For the cost of the hotel I was bit surprised at the amount of dust in the room I was also surprised to hear doors slamming from the hallway while in my room sleeping \n",
      "-  Night trip to bathroom light lights the bed area disturbing spouse Less table space no dress drawers tiny wash basin area \n",
      "-  There is nothing i didnt like but would like to suggest if they could provide Hot Kettle Iron and bottle of waters in the room like all other hotels do Nevertheless it was still amazing and we were served on request\n",
      "-  The Internet on the eighth floor could have been faster maybe invest in another router for the top floors Room would benefit from minor refurbishment work \n",
      "-  The layout of the room and bathroom was not what I expected from a 4 star property But this was overshadowed by the quality of the staff at the hotel \n",
      "-  Although we were upgraded to a suite it was lacking storage drawers The room was fantastic but I guess they expect you to only have hanging clothes and live our of your suite case \n",
      "-  I cannot fault them The room staff kept the room spotless and all services were very friendly \n",
      "-  Glass door on bathroom I doubt the architect ever tried using the bathroom \n",
      "-  Someone wrote soundproof well its not really so but there is no noise from the other rooms and from outside just police cars or if there is a band playing just in front of the hotel but really quite at night\n",
      "-  I would have liked if the hotel has a leisure centre although I know we had access to a swimming pool and gym at another location We had great air con too but as we were situated so high up our room had a large floor to ceiling picture window but this did not for safety reasons open \n",
      "-  The pullout couch bed was horrible but I guess there is no such thing as real triple room in Europe Wireless is very bad \n",
      "-  In the bathroom facilities there is a build up of moisture and dust where the glass meets the floor this needs a brush\n",
      "-  Personally we didn t like the bath in the bedroom itself with no privacy \n",
      "-  wifi was very weak and intermittent The layout of the room was contemporary and modern but not user friendly for families with kids particularly bathroom and WC \n",
      "-  room facilities were bizarre no bathroom as such small sink behind a wall plus two small cubicles for WC and shower respectively sharing a sliding door no doors on the wardrobe It s a pity because it somewhat tarnishes an otherwise perfect stay \n",
      "-  The wifi connection was really bad in our room And the bathtub was not cleaned before we checked in But this aside everything was amazing \n",
      "-  The cleaning of room But due to tired and jetlag of traveling we woke up late coz of time difference so our room wasnt able to clean up But if we woke up early and leave hotel early then the room will be cleaned \n",
      "-  Whilst the room service staff were very helpful and friendly the food was average at best \n",
      "-  The wifi is slow When I commented on it the staff tried their best to speed it up Which was great service The windows of our room was to the sea and it was not possible to block out the morning sun with the curtains \n",
      "-  2 things which are still fine Lights in the room either too dark or too bright maybe a separate switch for each light will be easier Music in the corridor maybe the volume should be reduced Something nice a small coffee machine in the room everyone does that now so why not a nice hotel like Olivia Plaza \n",
      "-  The room didn t have a desk \n",
      "-  I didnt like the fact there was no opening window in our room although being on the 10th floor might be a factor with H S Mini bar in common with all other mini bars in the world was very expensive maybe halving the price would mean selling twice as much 4 for a kitkat \n",

      "-  Furniture in common areas look worn Lack of storage space for cloths only some open shelves no separate bathroom just a small toilet w a class sliding door which means privacy is quite limited and we didn t like the painted floor in the entrance area or the red wall in the room not cozy And the fluorescent lighting in the room was ridiculous looked more like an operating room in a hospital than a hotel lighting no way to dim these super bright lights Cleanliness limited to the basic dust collecting e g on floor lists in room and in common areas Difficult to control the room temperature \n",

      "-  Breakfest room is small selection and quality of breakfest is ok but not great \n",

      "-  At night when turning on the lights in the room there is almost too much light and not enough control over it A few more Towel hangers would be nice \n",
      "-  The lights in the room are very annoying they are very bright and not well organized the spotlights are exactly toward the pillows and the side light too bright and the three of them switched on with on switch the bathroom has 4 spotlight with one switch there is no way to use one light So at night I use my mobile flash to see my way through because switching on the four spotlights will definitely woke my partner up since bathroom s walls are glass \n",
      "-  It is very European so don t expect the Ritz No counter space in bathroom but we managed Lots of room elsewhere There is no hotel lobby It is up a flight of stairs to a small wooden desk with attendant Not much room to even stand while checking in except on the stairs Must carry bags up the first flight of stairs then elevator to room The attendant helped get our bags up the stairs \n",
